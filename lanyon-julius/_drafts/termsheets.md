# Fundraising 101

In the startup environment of 2015, a ton of money gets distributed daily to new companies by venture capital firms, angels, institutional investors, individuals and many more actors. Some people insist that we are seeing a major bubble rise. This might be true or not but that does not change the fact that fundraising is one of the *main activities* of a startups CEO or key personnel. Many entrepreneurs that I met during my time at MIT recounted being more of a "Chief Fundraising Officer" than CEO for the first months of their companies.

This means that any head-start you can get on the fundraising process is of tremendous advantage. In a series of blogposts I want to share with you my insights from two MIT courses that I took on the matter, 10.407 - Money for Startups and 15.431 - Entreprenerial Finance. Disclaimer: I have not gone through funding processes myself yet - but I am planning to do so and I think meticulous preparation is the best way. Speaking with seasoned entrepreneurs, investors, reading blogs and my classes have helped me form a good theoretical idea that I would like to put forward to the reader. This is not a guide on how to pitch your company or how to approach potential investors. This is purely related to the finance process of fundraising. Another caveat: I will not be covering debt-financing either, this is purely equity financing related. 

<div class="message">Equity financing means giving up a percentage of your company in return for funds rather than taking on debts that will need to be repaid later on. In [finance theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_theorem), there is supposedly no difference between the two, albeit relying on the absence of transaction costs, taxes and a whole other lot of real life issues. This article gives a good overview over the discussion of [debt- vs. equity financing](http://www.nfib.com/article/ital-50036/).</div>

In the following articles I want to cover seven topics, starting with number 1 below. I will frequently link to other blogs and sites that have good insights for more detailed discussions. I would like to see the blog as a forum for discussion. If you disagree with any of the content, leave a comment. If you have any experience, leave a comment. The more discussion, the better. 

1. Sources of money
2. Valuing ventures
3. Investment structures
4. Termsheets - what do they look like and what are the most important items?
5. The role of lawyers and legal counsel
6. Negotiations
7. The investor / VC perspective

## 1. Sources of money

Sources of money and actors in the venture financing business are abundant. There are angels, accelerators, incubators, VC funds, strategic funds, institutional investors, friends and family, grants, and so on and so on. How should you know what is right for you and what is not? VC money definitely is not always the right answer, as this [blogpost by Laurie Peterson](http://www.fastcompany.com/3036130/hit-the-ground-running/why-venture-capital-wasnt-right-for-me-and-15-alternative-funding-sou) perfectly illustrates. She also provides an excellent overview over the type of sources of funding that you can leverage next to traditional VC funding. 

Especially companies in seed or early funding stage can often profit from alternative funding models to traditional, large VCs. The infographic below demonstrates that VCs have been reluctant to make seed stage investments in recent years, even though the sums of money have increased. Early stage deals have been faring better but the number has been decreasing as of this quarter. This evidence clearly warrants a second look at the alternatives, some of which I will illustrate in this post.

### "Free Money"

The first option to consider when fundraising are sources of "free money", i.e. money that does not imply relinquishing equity in the company or taking on debt obligations. I would differentiate between three major categories here:
<!-- Talk about grants, competitions, summer programs, include links -->
#### 1. Grants and government schemes

Grants are an extremely useful way to receive funding for early stage research. Grants are usually an option in university environments and are tied to specific types of research.
<!-- research financing with grants -->

#### 2. Competitions

Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available startup competitions(http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/). 
There is an abundance of entrepreneurship competitions throughout the US and Europe. Most competitions hand out cash-prizes and in many cases offer additional benefits such as consulting, engineering expertise or introductions to further programs. Grasshopper has compiled a great list with many available [startup competitions](http://grasshopper.com/blog/startup-competition-guide/). 

<!-- The list below contains a continuously updated list of competitions with prizes. **Feel free to submit competitions [here](TODO: INSERT LINK) for inclusion on the list**
 -->

<!-- Make list with competitions, main prize, location and focus -->

#### 3. Summer programs

Summer programs are another great way to raise money free of cost with the added benefit of mentorship and often office space for several months. The mentorship aspect is actually the most valuable aspect of the offer. Usually, teams participating in those types of programs are strung together in "classes" and go through the program together. The lessons learned from one another plus many bonus programs, workshops and mentorship lessons that the accelerators offer make these programs tremendously valuable. Since many of these programs are conducted by VCs or by major universities, they are also an excellent opportunity expand your network for possible future funding. 

Some of the more prominent summer programs are:

[Summer@Highland](http://summer.hcp.com/): Check out their blog at http://summerathighland.tumblr.com/ for more details and to know what being part of a summer program is like.

[Lightspeed Ventures Fellowship](http://lsvp.com/summer-fellowships/)

[MIT GFSA accelerator](http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/)

<!-- Make list with accelerators and find example blogpost that shows a day in an accelerator.  -->

The caveat with these sources is that you can absolutely not plan for or rely on them. Especially in grants the application process might be very lengthy and burdensome. Competitions and summer programs however are definitely an important stepping stone, giving entrepreneurs the opportunity to re-work pitches, to network and to gain general public exposure for their company.

### Angels, Angel Funds and Micro-VCs

Angels in a nutshell are wealthy individuals that usually have either founded a company before or accumulated significant industry expertise. Angels commonly invest between $100.000 to $1.000.000, or more in exceptional cases. For a brief summary on angel investors, read http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/52742. Next to providing initial seed money, angel investors can be of tremendous help with their usually extensive networks and expertise. Angel investors have the reputation to not make money in the fundraising community as many of their investments are in very risky early stage or seed companies. Studies have shown this conception [not to be true](http://www.angelblog.net/Angel_Returns.html). For some further reading on angels, visit:

* [Angel List (You should really know this website)](http://angel.co/)
* [Different Types of Angels](http://nextviewventures.com/blog/different-types-of-angel-investors/)

Angel investor groups have nuanced differences as well.
<!-- 
* Angel groups: 
* Angel funds:
* Angel syndicates: -->

Angel investor groups or funds consist of several angels that have joined forces in order to combine expertise and to pool financial resources, allowing greater investments. They usually average around 100 members, are region-specific and can differ in the industries they invest in. There are more nuanced differences between angel funds, angel groups, and angel list syndicates. F

Micro-VCs are venture capital funds with smaller amounts of assets under management (AUM), usually below $50m but up to about $100m. Micro-VCs primarily engage in seed and early-stage deals and invest smaller amounts of money. The current early stage average deal size for Micro-VCs is $3.4m. I have included several links for great readings on micro-VCs here:
