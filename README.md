# Blog
Code for my personal blog

This blog was built with the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). 

I blog about a variety of themes at [http://blog.juliusdanek.de](http://blog.juliusdanek.de).

My blog is hosted on a digital ocean server and was built with Jekyll. 

Setting it up was actually a piece of pain but I finally managed. Configured it with an archive view, will add categories soon as well.

Feel free to reuse the theme and the archive page. Included an assets/images for the images I host.
